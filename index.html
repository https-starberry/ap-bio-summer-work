                            I like the ocean because of how blue it is. Not only that, I like the feeling of swimming in cool waters on a hot sunny day. Although, accidentally drinking salty water isn't my favorite part of it.  I like the sound of the waves splashing around.

                        <div>
                            I can answer this question! Three abiotic factors are temperature, salinity, and solar energy. Solar energy serves as the basis for all life, so of course it's the same for life underwater. Aquatic plants use sunlight for photosynthesis which fuels the food web. Salinity is another one as many species of fish in the ocean are accustomed to the saltiness of the ocean. If it becomes too salty or not salty enough, these organisms would struggle to adapt as they're not accustomed to the salinity fluctuating. Lastly, temperature affects the survival, development, and reproduction of many oceanic species. When the temperature is just right, these creatures will behave as expected and observed. But if it changes then they will attempt to migrate for food, reproduction, and survival in general.

                            This is part of the reason why climate change is such a large issue today. Not only will it cause the polar ice caps to melt, marine heat waves, and acidification of the ocean, it will also negatively affect the ocean's biodiversity. Many species will migrate to find cooler waters which may interrupt ecosystems that aren't capable of handling such a large influx. Right now, there's been a 1.1℃ in temperature which means about 60% of these ecosystems have been degraded. If it increases to 1.5℃, then it will jump to anywhere between 70% and 90%. Should it ever reach a 2℃ increase in temperature then we've officially reached the point of no return.

                            It does, unfortunately. Sharks, for example, help maintain the populations of fish they eat. Without sharks, these fish would begin to eat away at the populations of producers (like algae and phytoplankton) which would have disastrous consequences on other species that also consume these producers for survival. Phytoplankton helps to fuel the food web. Without them, fish wouldn't have a food source and therefore would affect the levels above them. Lastly, coral reefs are depended on by fish to provide shelter to raise their young and reproduce. They also allow fish to find food. Without them, these fish would struggle to survive and reproduce. Biotic factors like these will suffer under climate change and if invasive species are added to the mix, it'll worsen the situation exponentially.

                            When they're introduced to a new habitat, they don't have any natural predators so they're able to reproduce freely. Because of this, they usually overpower native species and outcompete them for resources. They can also disrupt the habitat by invading and claiming territories for themselves. There's also the chance they could change the quality of the water, spread diseases, and increase competition.

                        <div>
                            No, since parasitism involves a host and a "parasite." The "parasite" usually lives in or with the host and slowly kills them off which allows them to reap the benefits. A benefit could be having an organism to lay its eggs in. An example of one would be swimming crabs and barnacles.

                            That pairing is interesting because barnacles don't cause any harm to whales. The relationship between these two is called commensalism. This relationship only requires that one party benefits and the other doesn't benefit or lose from engaging in the relationship. Whales don't gain anything from this relationship, but the barnacles do.

                            So it's a bit different from mutualism where both parties benefit from their relationship like clownfish and anemones.

                            But these are different from predator and prey relationships where the predator hunts the prey for nutrition. For example, tiger sharks are the predator and a keystone specie and the green sea turtle is the prey.

                            An example of competition for food would be sponges and coral. If sponges are too successful they end up monopolizing food that the coral also needs to survive. But this tipping on the scale towards sponges will never last too long because once coral start to die off the reef is damaged and the sponges follow soon after. A balance in competition has to be maintained for the ecosystem to prosper.

                            Competition for finding a mate is another example. Dall's porpoises have a ritual called "mate guarding." Once a male finds a partner he guards her to make sure she isn't able to mate with other males. So males without partners are constantly fighting with males with partners for a chance to reproduce.

                            There's also competition for territory. Peacock mantis shrimp are SUPER territorial. They only ever interact with each other during mating season, but then return to solitude once it's over. They use stomatopod rumbles or vibrations to communicate warnings to other mantis shrimp and predators. If a mantis shrimp gets too close to its territory it will use its colorful body to ward them off.

                            Kelp has gas-filled floats (pneumatocysts) to help buoy their leaves close to the sun. This allows them to perform photosynthesis easier. Seaweed on the other hand can take in nutrients from anywhere in the body (thallus), not just their roots like "normal" plants do.

                            Sea turtles are great examples of innate behaviors. Once sea turtles have hatched they immediately know they have to reach the ocean as fast as possible as there are predators that actively wait for them to hatch. Baby sea turtles instinctively move in the direction that has the most amount of light. If you think about it, it makes sense as to why. Since they hatch at night, the brightest light source (usually) is the moon. Lastly, sea turtles can't breathe underwater. They don't have gills, so they have to resurface to get the oxygen they need. As sea turtles don't raise their young they're born with this instinct of resurfacing.

                            Orcas are prime examples of learned behaviors. Just like humans, they have a language, distinct culture, and cultural pride, and pass on information orally. Within the Orca language, there are dialects. These dialects are the core of each pod's culture. A transient Orca's dialect is starkly different from a resident Orca's dialect. Calves learn their pod's language by mimicking the other orcas within their pod. At first, these are clumsy attempts but eventually, they learn what context to use certain whistles, calls, and clicks.

                            As disturbing as it sounds, it's a hunting tactic that can take years to learn. This method is often taught by elders of the pods to the calves. Some members of the pod never learn this technique as the feeling of their body out of water is enough to psych them out. The ones that do learn how to become exceptionally great hunters.

                            Just like any human culture, Orcas teach and pass their pod's culture to their children. So they not only teach hunting strategies and their language but also what foods they choose to eat, how to interact with other Orcas, what species are their friends and who are their foes, etc. We know that this is true because it's been observed countless times that calves learn through mimicry and not innate behaviors like sea turtles. It makes sense as to why they evolved to be this way. Their parents and other relatives raise and teach them how to survive.

                            We also can't forget that humans would fight over these new territories since this would be an unprecedented event. There would be maritime disputes over how much of the ocean belongs to "x" country. There also wouldn't be any laws to protect the ocean and its residents because governments take too long negotiating terms that only benefit themselves and not the greater good.
